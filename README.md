Project Description

Numbers dont lie and they perfectly tell you in a short time as to how is the company doing, this tool does just that, it takes numbers, calculates basic ratios and gives a health check for any company listed on the stock market. 

You just need to enter the company’s stock code (for example, TSLA for Tesla) in the input box.

The program automatically pulls the most recent financial data of the company from Yahoo Finance and calculates key financial ratios such as:

- Profit Margin
- Return on Equity (ROE %)
- Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- Current Ratio

It then displays clear graphs to help visualize the company’s financial performance.

Finally, the project gives a quick health check summary, such as:
- Profitability
- Potential liquidity concerns
- Debt levels

This helps you quickly understand the company’s current financial position using data from the most recent year.
